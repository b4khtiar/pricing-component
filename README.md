## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Utilizing functional :has() to target specific state and element so the payment switch could dynamicly shows the annual/monthly price, without javascript needed.

- Trying to keep custom switch accessible using :focus pseudoclass

### Useful resources

- Switch toggle inspired by [gharsh11032000 on uiverse.io](https://uiverse.io/gharsh11032000/green-liger-89) - its simple and looks great.
- Explanation of :has() pseudo class on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has) - The functional pseudo class used to switch annual/monthly price visibility.
